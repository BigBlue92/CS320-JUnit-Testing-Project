# CS320-JUnit-Testing-Project
Code written for the JUnit tests in CS320


**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
     If you're coding in Java, writing JUnit test to cover your code is an excellent way to ensure your code runs properly. If the customer has certain data requirements, or if you find the need to implement some yourself, JUnit tests can ensure that your code accomodates for these requirements. For example, if a phone number field is meant to only contain numbers, you can add your validation code and write a JUnit test to ensure your validation works.


**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
     Interpreting user needs is extremely important when it comes to software development. Things need to be considered such as human error. If the customer needs their users to enter a phone number, you should consider adding validation to ensure an actual phone number is entered. You should think about how your customer will be using your software and how effective it will be for them.

**How do I approach designing software**
    The way I like to write software is starting with the requirements. From there, I can write automated tests that validate these requirements. After the tests are done, I can start writing code to fulfill those tests. I'll know I'm done coding once all tests are passed.
